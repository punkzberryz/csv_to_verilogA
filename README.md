# csv_to_verilogA

Python script to convert CSV register map to Verilog-A. The CSV format is specific, so if you want to use this script, you need to modify the internal code, or create CSV file that has the same format as test.csv.

To run this:

- from Terminal, browse/cd to the csv_to_verilogA directory
- in terminal, run "python csv_to_verilogA.py"
- this will convert test.csv file to output test_regmap.vams
